This repository contains three common chart examples—Bar, Pie, and Polar—using ApexCharts.

### Chart Types:

- **Bar Chart**: Rectangular bars represent data.
- **Pie Chart**: Circular graph displays proportional data slices.
- **Polar Chart**: Data visualized in a circular graph.

### Usage:

- **Type**: Determines the chart's visualization type. Refer to the [ApexCharts documentation](https://apexcharts.com/docs) for more types.
- **Options**: Global and specific options for each chart type are defined within the components.
- **Series**: Data supplied to ApexChart shapes the visual representation. Each chart has a unique data structure.
